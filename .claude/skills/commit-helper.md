description: Organize uncommitted changes into logical commits
---

Run the commit helper to organize changes into logical commits with generated commit messages.

This will:
1. Show all uncommitted changes grouped by category
2. Suggest conventional commit messages
3. Let you select what to commit together
4. Stage and commit selected changes

Usage: Type `/commit-helper` or bind to a keyboard shortcut
