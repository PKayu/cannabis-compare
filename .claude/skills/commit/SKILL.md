# Commit Skill

1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Group changed files by logical area (backend, frontend, scrapers, tests, docs, config)
3. For each group, run `git add <files>` then `git commit -m "<type>: <description>"`
4. Use conventional commit prefixes: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore
5. After all commits, show `git log --oneline -10`
6. Ask user if they want to push
