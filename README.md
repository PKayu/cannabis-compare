## AI Workflow (Claude + Codex)

- Claude workflow instructions remain in `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`.
- Codex workflow instructions are in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/codex/`.
- Codex workflow guide: `docs/codex/WORKFLOW.md`
- Claude-to-Codex mapping: `docs/codex/MAPPING.md`
- Task templates: `docs/codex/templates/`

## Tech Stack

The public UI is being migrated incrementally to **Mountain Bloom**. Search and product evaluation are the active pilot; other routes retain their existing presentation. See [the pilot handoff](docs/ux/PILOT-HANDOFF.md) for capability mappings, browser-test commands, screenshots and outstanding approval gates. Do not wholesale-import the Lovable project or treat the pilot as fully approved.

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (Python) & Prisma (for schema definition)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) + Supabase (Backend/DB)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- Python 3.10+ (for backend development)
- PostgreSQL or Supabase account

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Install all dependencies
scripts\install-deps.bat

# Start both servers
scripts\start-dev.bat
```

### Manual Setup

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` files in each directory for required environment variables.
